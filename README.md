# To study ageing in viscoelastic materials that can be modelled by Maxwell-Voigt type description.
# System under study:
## Material-1: Exponential ageing $\rightarrow  \tau (t) = \exp (t/t_0)$ 
## Material-2: Power law ageing $\rightarrow \tau (t) =  (t/t_0)^m $
## The phenomena of ageing is studied in micro rheology via brownian motion of tracer bead particles. Hence, we appropriately modelled the materials and simulated the tracer bead trajectory to get insight into it.
