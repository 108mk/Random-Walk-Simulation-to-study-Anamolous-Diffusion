# To study ageing in viscoelastic materials that can be modelled by Maxwell Voigt type description.
# The phenomena of ageing is studied in micro rheology via brownian dynamics of tracer bead particles.
# Hence, we appropriately modelled the materials and simulated the tracer bead trajectory to get insight into it.
